    <h3>3. How we collect and store that information</h3>
    <p>We take appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure that the information disclosed to us is kept secure, accurate, and up to date, and that it is kept only for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which it is used.</p>

    <p>You should be aware that the use of the internet is not entirely secure, and although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security or integrity of any personal information that is transferred from you or to you via the internet. Any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features such as encryption to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

    <h3>4. What we use your information for</h3>
    <p>We collect your data on the occasions listed in section 3, “Why we collect that Information”.</p>

    <p>We use the information we have collected to deliver to you 1) information and services connected with the goal of this website, and 2) any newsletters you subscribe to. We may tell you about news and updates, ask you to participate in surveys, and check how we are doing in our goal.</p>

    <p>Where we have asked for your consent, we may use your image in our materials on our website, at events, and for other promotional purposes.</p>

    <h3>5. On what legal basis we use your information</h3>
    <p>We have a lawful basis for collecting your data as set out in section 3, “Why we collect that Information”, and for using the data for the purposes described in section 4, “What we use your information for”.</p>

    <p>Lawful basis may include:
      <ul class="privacy">
        <li>Where it is within our legitimate interests to process your information to further our goal to create an easy to use online planetarium. We know that under this basis of processing, we have a heightened responsibility to keep your interests central and to make sure that your rights as a data subject override our legitimate interest.</li>
        <li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
        <li>Where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party. If you fail to provide this information, we may be unable to perform the contract.</li>
        <li>Where we have your consent. If we want to use your image for the purposes of our mission, then we will ask you to consent to that use. Very occasionally, we will also process other areas of sensitive personal data, but we will always ask for your consent to do this.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>6. Who we share your information with</h3>
    <p>We never exchange or sell your information to any third party.</p>

    <h3>7. How long we keep your information for</h3>
    <p>We keep your information for no longer than is necessary for our purposes. What is necessary will depend on the reason for which the information was collected.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions about how long we keep your information, contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@noctua-software.com">contact@noctua-software.com</a></p>

    <h3>8. Your rights</h3>
    <p><strong>Right of access</strong> — you have a right to ask us to confirm whether we are processing information about you, and to request access to this information.</p>

    <p><strong>Right to rectification</strong> — you may ask us to rectify information you think is inaccurate, and you may also ask us to remove information which is inaccurate or incomplete. If you inform us that your personal data is inaccurate, we will inform relevant third parties with whom we have shared your data so that they may update their own records.</p>

    <p><strong>Right of portability</strong> — you have a right to obtain your personal data from us and reuse it for your own purposes.</p>

    <p><strong>Right to be forgotten</strong> — you have a right to seek the erasure of your data, for example where it is no longer necessary for us to continue holding or processing your personal data. This right is not absolute, as we may need to continue processing this information to comply with a legal obligation.</p>

    <p><strong>Right to restriction</strong> — you have a right to ask us to restrict our processing of your information if:
      <ul class="privacy">
        <li>You contest its accuracy and we need to verify whether it is accurate.</li>
        <li>You ask us to restrict use of it instead of deleting it.</li>
        <li>We no longer need the information for the purpose of processing, but you need it to establish or defend legal claims.</li>
        <li>You have objected to processing of your information being necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. The restriction would apply while we carry out a balancing act between your rights and our legitimate interests. If you exercise your right to restrict processing, we would still need to process your information for the purpose of exercising or defending legal claims, for the purpose of protecting the rights of another person, or for public interest reasons.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

We will act in accordance with your instructions as soon as reasonably possible, and there will be no charge.</p>
